 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Document's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
 and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer
 to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
 other recipients of the Document a copy of this License along with
 the Document.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of producing or transferring
 a copy.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Document or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Document, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1

     a) You must cause the modified files to carry notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Document or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.
 .
     c) You must not add notes to the Document implying that the
     reader had better read something produced using Texinfo.

 3. You may copy and distribute the Document (or a work based on it,
 under Section 2) in any form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
 provided that you also either accompany it with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code, or provide an URL, valid for at least

 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
 except as expressly provided under this License.

 5. Each time you redistribute the Document (or any work based on the

 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Document subject to
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
